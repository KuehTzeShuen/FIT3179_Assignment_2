            <h2>Alcohol Consumption per Capita</h2>
            <p>
              The map shows the average alcohol consumption in liters of pure
              alcohol among people aged 15 and older for the year 2018. Higher
              alcohol consumption is observed across Europe, Russia, Australia,
              Canada, and parts of South America, while lower levels appear in
              Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. This map shows a
              significant variation in drinking habits across different regions
              of the world. Even thoough the map shows a global perspective per
              capita, it is clear that economic status is not the only factor
              that affects drinking patterns. Local cultural, social, and
              demographic factors influence alcohol consumption patterns as
              well. <br />
              <br />

              Australia's alcohol consumption per capita is around 10.51 liters
              , placing it above the OECD average of 8.6 liters. This makes
              Australia one of the highest consumers of alcohol globally,
              marking it as a significant part of the country's social and
              cultural practices.

            <h2>Alcohol Consumption in Australia</h2>
            <p>
              The multi-line chart narrows our scope from a global scale to show
              trends in the average liters of alcohol consumed per person in
              Australia specifically, broken down by beverage type (Beer, Wine,
              Spirits, and Cider), along with total alcohol consumption. From
              1980 to 2018, total alcohol consumption per capita in Australia
              shows a general decline, falling from over 12.72 liters in the
              early 1980 to 9.51 liters by 2021. Beer consumption, which
              dominated in the 1980s at around 8 liters per capita, decreased
              steadily over time to around 4 liters in present times. Wine
              consumption, on the other hand, gradually increased, especially
              from the 1980s onward, and is set to overtake beer consumption at
              the current rates. Spirits consumption rose slightly but remained
              moderate throughout the period at around 2 liters, while cider
              consumption only began in Australia in 2003 according to this
              dataset. <br /><br />

              Overall, the data suggests a long-term shift in Australians
              drinking habits from beer toward wine and other beverages, and a
              gradual reduction in total alcohol intake over the decades. This
              marks a cultural shift towards prioritising health and wellness,
              which has become the topic of many public health campaigns in
              recent years.

            <h2>
              Proportion of adults in Australia who exceeded guideline by age,
              2022
            </h2>
            <p>
              Despite the decline in overall alcohol consumption, alcoholism (or
              binge drinking) still remains a big issue in Australia. The chart
              presents the percentage of Australian adults who consumed alcohol
              at levels exceeding the national health guidelines, grouped by
              age. The data reveals a strong age-related pattern. The highest
              proportion of adults exceeding the guideline occurs among those
              aged 18-24, with roughly one-third of individuals in this group
              drinking above the recommended levels. The proportions then
              generally decline with age. Adults aged 25-34 and 35-44 also show
              notable rates of excess consumption, while older age groups,
              particularly those aged 65 years and over, are less likely to
              exceed the guideline. This pattern suggests that younger adults
              are more likely to engage in risky drinking behaviors compared
              with older populations, highlighting the importance of targeted
              public health interventions for early adult age groups.

            <h2>
              Alcohol Consumption Guideline Exceedance by Sex in Australia
            </h2>
            <p>
              Breaking it down even further, the diverging bar chart shows the
              proportion of Australian adults exceeding alcohol consumption
              guidelines in 2022 by sex. Across nearly all age groups, males
              consistently outnumber females in exceeding the guideline,
              indicating higher rates of risky drinking among men. The largest
              numbers of exceedances occur in the 25-34, 35-44 and over 65 age
              groups for males, and 25-34 and 45-54 in females, reflecting peak
              drinking years. In contrast, the 15-17 and 18-24 age groups show a
              lot lower levels of exceedance. Overall, the chart highlights a
              clear gender disparity in alcohol consumption patterns, with men
              more likely to drink beyond recommended limits. All in all, these
              insights underscore the need for more public awareness on
              responsible drinking habits, especially among younger adults to
              maintain the current trends, as even though overall alcohol
              consumption is declining, risky drinking behaviors are still a
              persistent occurance in Australia.
